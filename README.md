## Description:

* Safety: Safety is based on the number of arrests in each neighborhood. The least amount of arrests in the neighborhood shows that the neighborhood is theoretically safer than other neighborhoods where the number of arrests is higher.

* Walkability: Walkability is based on walk scores. These scores take into account distance, density, traffic, block length, and intersection density. Walk score also correlates with locations of public buildings and areas such as schools, stores, and restaurants. 

* Wealth: Wealth is based on the median household income of families in specific neighborhoods. A higher median household correlates with a generally nicer neighborhood. This also correlates with more job opportunity and employment. 

## About the Repository

* This repository was meant to analyze the best neighborhood in Pittsburhg by using three metrics of our choosing, those being safety, walkability and wealth.
