## Description:

* Safety: Safety is based on the percentage between the number of arrests per population in each neighborhood. The lowest percentage of arrests in the neighborhood shows that the neighborhood is theoretically safer than other neighborhoods where the percentage is higher.

* Walkability: Walkability is based on walk scores. These scores take into account distance, density, traffic, block length, and intersection density. Walk score also correlates with locations of public buildings and areas such as schools, stores, and restaurants. 

* Education: Education is based on the percentage of people who attend school at each specific given neighborhood. The more people who attend a neighborhood would be better because it means that the people in those neighborhoods get more opportunities to learn, as well as the opportunity to develop in a social environment which will improve their social skills. The highest percentage indicates that the neighborhood has a better overall education. 

## About the Repository

* This repository was meant to analyze the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by using three metrics of our choosing, those being safety, walkability and education.
